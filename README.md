# Description
## Shell scripting examples

The blogs are displayed on the [Enterprise Software
Blogs](https://community.broadcom.com/enterprisesoftware/browse/blogs)
section on the DX Application Performance Management community
platform (Forums).   
   
It is a blog collection to show an easy way to use functions to ease
one's day to day work, and write a library to re-use these functions
in scripts as these are the base
   
The following blog entries have been writte:   
1. [Shell scripting: log handler](https://community.broadcom.com/enterprisesoftware/blogs/jmertin/2020/02/11/shell-scripting-log-handler)
2. [Shell scripting: error handling](https://community.broadcom.com/enterprisesoftware/blogs/jmertin/2020/02/12/shell-scripting-error-handler)
3. [Shell scripting: using lock-files](https://community.broadcom.com/enterprisesoftware/blogs/jmertin/2020/02/12/shell-scripting-using-lock-files)
4. [Shell scripting: CLI UI handling](https://community.broadcom.com/enterprisesoftware/blogs/jmertin/2020/03/25/shell-scripting-cli-ui-handling)
5. Shell scription: handling program execution dependencies/semaphore?

Note: Even though these is example code, it will probably evolve over
time. So in case things do not match exactly with the example blogs,
don't be alarmed. Adapt ;)
